\textbf{\Large Letter of Recommendation} \\
\textbf{Dear \textit{\FondNavn } scholarship office,}

\textbf{The purpose of this letter of recommendation is to portray why Barakat Bokharaie should be granted a scholarship by {\FondNavn } for his studies at \textit{Nanyang Technological University (NTU)}, Singapore}

My name is Torben Almskou and I'm an assistant professor at \textit{Aarhus University Engineering College, Department of Mechanical Engineering}. For the last 2 years I’'ve been supervising and teaching in the subjects of \textit{Computer Aided Design (CAD), Machine Elements} and \textit{Manufacturing Processing}. These subjects are fundamental skills that any mechanical engineer should master.

Barakat Bokharaie has been one of my students in said courses during the last three semesters. I consider Barakat a highly dedicated, imaginative and serious student - a belief which is shared among all his other teachers and fellow students. Barakat’s seriousness with his studies is reflected in his grades: he completed his recent semester with utter grades of 10 and 12’'s (12 is the highest grade in the Danish Grading System corresponds to A in the international grading system) and holds a weighted average grade of \avgKar, which seats him at the top of his class. He has achieved his outstanding grades by putting a monstrous effort and countless hours in his studies and school projects. Barakat has worked this hard to be qualified to be considered and enter NTU, as the competition is very harsh, as NTU is a well-renowned, established and globally acknowledged technical university.

During his fourth semester, Barakat has been employed as a student assistant, as requested from his teachers. Thus, Barakat becomes responsible for teaching his fellow students in the lower classes, and he will also organize learning events for high school student interested in engineering. His work will result in creating awareness of how important engineers are, among the younger generation.

When having so high ambitions, and put the necessary amount of work into it, and thus possessing the talent to reach them, it is only natural to support Barakat to reach them. His stay at NTU will help Barakat develop to even greater heights. His studies in NTU will teach Barakat engineering disciplines that he is very fond of and not possible to be taught at Aarhus University, such as artificial intelligence. Studying abroad will also expand his professional network and develop his competencies in teamworking in an international environment - a highly regarded asset for a mechanical engineer. This will make him a great asset for Aarhus University and the Danish society in general, as he will acquire knowledge of the newest science and technology, which he can apply in Denmark.

In short, I can highly recommend Barakat Bokharaie to receive a grant by \FondNavn. \vspace{-3mm}
